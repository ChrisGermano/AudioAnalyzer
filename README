How to compile:
=====================
Code will be automatically compiled when running the included p4500 file.
NOTE: The p4500 file must be in the same directory as the source files when run.


Running the Code:
=====================
When in the directory containing the source and p4500 files
run the following command:

./p4500 -f/-d <filepath1> -f/-d <filepath2>

Where <filepath1> and <filepath2> are absolute paths of the audio files to be
compared. The -f tag must be used before a filepath referencing a single test
file, and the -d tag must be used before a filepath referencing a directory
containing any number of test files.

Eclipse was used to develop and test our code.

The FFT algorithm detailed in this link was used to analyze audio files -
